<tr><th align="center">Day</th><th>Place</th><th>Things to do</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td>Johanesburg</td><td>On arrival at Johannesburg airport, you catch your next flight to Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport, which takes just under an hour. On arrival in Kruger, you're met at the airport by our representative and assisted with the collection of your hire car. It's then a pretty half an hour drive to Hazyview through the wooded hills of Mpumalanga. After settling into your accommodation, spend the rest of the day relaxing or explore the surrounding area at your leisure.
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2</td><td>Johanesburg</td><td> Hazyview
Spend today exploring the Drakensberg Escarpment, home to some of the most dramatic scenery in South Africa. Driving along the Panorama Route today allows you to take in views over mountains, waterfalls and canyons. You can also learn about the chequered history of the region and visit Pilgrim's Rest, an old gold mining town with Victorian-era buildings still standing. Other activities in the area include hiking, white water rafting and hot air balloon rides, as well as visits to Nespruit Botanical Gardens and Sudwala Caves.
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">3</td><td>Hazyview</td><td>This morning you drive for around two hours from Hazyview to Sabi Sand Wildtuin, a private reserve on the edge of Kruger National Park. After settling into your luxurious lodge, this afternoon you embark on your first game drive in the park with a knowledgeable guide, who can help track wildlife and tell you more about each species.
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">4</td><td>The Sabi Sand Wildtuin</td><td>Spend most of the day on safari. Your day starts with an early morning game drive, when the wildlife is at its most active. You then return to your lodge for a hearty breakfast and have some free time to relax and enjoy your lodge's facilities. After lunch, you head out on your afternoon game drive, trying to see species you've yet to encounter. Enjoy sundowners in the bush before heading back for a delicious meal, sharing tales from your day with fellow guests.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">5</td><td>The Sabi Sand Wildtuin</td><td>Enjoy another full day on safari. Between game drives you could head out on a bush walk with an experienced guide. This gives you a different perspective on the area's wildlife as you learn about the wider ecosystem, follow animal tracks and concentrate on seeing smaller species such as birds, reptiles and insects.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">6</td><td>The Sabi Sand Wildtuin</td><td>This morning you depart Sabi Sand Wildtuin for the two hour drive back to the airport in time for your onward flights
