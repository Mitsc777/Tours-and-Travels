Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is located in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the UAE, and is considered to be the key site for worship in the country
The project was launched by the late president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who wanted to establish a 
structure that would unite the cultural diversity of the Islamic world with the historical and modern values of architecture and art.
His final resting place is located on the grounds beside the same mosque. The mosque was constructed from 1996 to 2007.
It is the largest mosque in the United Arab Emirates.
As the country's grand mosque, it is the key place of worship for Friday gathering and Eid prayers.
During Eid it may be visited by more than 41,000 people.
