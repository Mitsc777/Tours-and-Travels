About Malaysia

<div class="h3">
<p>To know Malaysia is to love Malaysia - a bubbling, bustling melting-pot of races and religions where Malays, Indians, Chinese and many other ethnic groups live together in peace and harmony.
Our multiculturalism has made Malaysia a gastronomical paradise and home to hundreds of colourful festivals.
It's no wonder that we love celebrating and socialising. As a people, Malaysians are very relaxed, warm and friendly. <br><br>
Geographically, Malaysia is almost as diverse as its culture.
11 states and 2 federal territories (Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya) form Peninsular Malaysia which is separated by the South China Sea from East Malaysia which includes the 2 states (Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo) and a third federal territory, the island of Labuan.<br><br>
One of Malaysia's key attractions is its extreme contrasts which further add to this theme of ‘diversity’. Towering skyscrapers look down upon wooden houses built on stilts while five-star hotels sit just metres away from ancient reefs.<br><br> 
Rugged mountains reach dramatically for the sky while their rainforest-clad slopes sweep down to floodplains teeming with forest life. Cool highland hideaways roll down to warm, sandy beaches and rich, humid mangroves.<br><br>
For the perfect holiday full of surprises, the time is now, the place is Malaysia.
